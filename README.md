# Jotform Text Casing widget
This widget allows for the conversion of text present in Jotform form fields into lowercase, uppercase or proper case. The output is transferred to Jotform Tables and can be used in conditions.

Demo form: https://www.jotform.com/221655896789075

Parameter setup:<br>
srcId - Text<br>
format - Dropdown (Lowercase, Uppercase, Propercase)<br>
trim - Checkbox (Yes)<br>

Due to the extreme simplicity of the logic, this widget can be a good blueprint for building iframe-based widgets that communicate with the rest of the form fields (which, from my experience, has not been done before).
